# Ragial-Price-Checker
This project was used to learn MVVM/WPF, so the implementation isn't perfect (it is decent, though). 
The software itself still works, and can be used as a tool to run price-checks over regular intervals in the Ragial website, 
which is a market-bot for International Ragnarok Online.
